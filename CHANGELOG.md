# Change Log

Runly.js is distributed as a [monorepo][monorepo] using [lerna][lerna]. Several other large open-source projects are distributed this way, including [Gatsby][gatsby], [babel][babel], [react][react], etc.

This means that our CHANGELOG.md files are distributed alongside the package itself:

* [`@runly/core`](./core/CHANGELOG.md)
* [`@runly/react-bootstrap`](./react-bootstrap/CHANGELOG.md)
* [HTML Integration](./html/CHANGELOG.md)
* [Example JS App](./example/CHANGELOG.md)

[gatsby]: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby
[babel]: https://github.com/babel/babel
