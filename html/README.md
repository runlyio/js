# Runly.js HTML Integration

> Prebuilt script that can be dropped on any HTML page to include Runly components

This integration is intended for maximum ease-of-use for server-rendered pages that have very little scripting already on the page.

[Learn how to use the runly.js HTML integration](https://www.runly.io/docs/integration/js/html/) in your application.

## Building Locally

After cloning the repo and [installing dependencies](../README.md#rocket-running-locally):

```
npm run bundle
```

This will use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to build the application into `runly.js` in the `dist` folder.
