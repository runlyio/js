# Runly.js HTML Site

> Example HTML site that uses the runly.js vanilla and HTML integrations.

## Running Locally

After cloning the repo and [installing dependencies](../../README.md#rocket-running-locally):

```
npm start
```

This will spin up a web server at `localhost:8080`.

This example makes use of the [HTML integration](../../html). Make sure to [build the HTML bundle](../../html/README.md#building-locally) before starting the web server.
